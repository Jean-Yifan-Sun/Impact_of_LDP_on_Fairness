# Impact-of-KRR-on-Fairness
Repository for the paper: Impact of Local Differential Privacy on Fairness. (Here the link to the arxiv needs to be added and the bibtex for citation).

# Codes & Datasets
All the experiments are implemented in Python 3. We use Random Forest model for classification with its default hyper-parameters and we use the
ten-fold cross-validation technique. For k-RR mechanism, we use the implementation in [Multi-Freq-LDPy Python library](https://github.com/hharcolezi/multi-freq-ldpy) (here we add the link to Heber's repository). Since LDP protocols and ML algorithms are randomized, we report average results over 20 runs.
